### Why is this in bootstrap

If you are a recruiter or looking to hire me and wondering why this is in Bootstrap and not some completely custom built site it's mostly down to time. I had people wanting my CV within a day of me starting design work so this needed to get built quickly and Bootstrap 4 was a good way to cut down on that extra development time.

### Why this isn't a SPA

This isn't a SPA for a couple of reasons.

Firstly cause I just needed a break from creating things in React and Vue. 

Secondly I wanted to explore Serverless and building sites using a serverless architecture. 

Thirdly I wanted good SEO and I'm not convinced a SPA can deliver that yet. 

Fourth simplicity, this site isn't complicated it didn't need a SPA with SSR and code splitting, simple handlebars, a lambda, s3 bucket, SaaS CMS and Cloudfront is already quite a few bits and pieces.
